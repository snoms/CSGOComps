# CSGO Comps

CSGO Comps is a simple app to compare player statistics for two Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players.

#### Required dependencies
For some reason I could not incorporate iOS-Charts into my git, so including it both in the Project Folder & Embedded Binaries is required.  

#### Features

- View and compare one or two CS:GO players
- Tracked statistics: Total Kills, Total Deaths, Total Shots fired, Total Shots hit, Total Time Played
- Uses STEAM API to acquire up to date data

#### Bugs / missing features
A more flexible data structure could be implemented to compare more than two players. Comparison result is only viewable in bar chart.


#### Version
